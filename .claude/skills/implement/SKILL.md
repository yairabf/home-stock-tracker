# implement - build the current spec, one reviewed step at a time

Where this sits in the workflow:

    /feature, /fix, or /rollback  ->  [implement]  ->  /complete  ->  next
    (the spec)                         (build it,       (commit +
                                        reviewed)        merge + log)

`/feature`, `/fix`, or `/rollback` wrote the spec to
`blueprint/context/current-feature.md` and stopped.
This skill turns that spec into code, following the build loop in
`blueprint/context/ai-interaction.md`, without vibe coding: small steps, a visible diff plus
a plain-English explanation for each, testing, and iteration until it works, all
behind your approval. It builds on a branch and offers an optional commit
checkpoint after each step; the work-level commit, merging, and logging are
`/complete`'s job.

## Before you start

Read `blueprint/context/current-feature.md`. If it has no real spec (still the stub, or its
status is already complete), stop and tell the user to run `/feature` (for a
planned feature), `/fix` (for an ad-hoc bug or change), or `/rollback` (for a
completed feature reversal) first. Pull the
conventions from `blueprint/context/coding-standards.md` and the data model from
`blueprint/context/project-overview.md` so the code matches them.

If the spec's Design reference points at `prototypes/*.html`, those mockups are
the visual target - build components to match them, and treat `prototypes/theme.css`
as the token source (the spec's first step ports it into the app's global
stylesheet before the components are built).

**Resuming?** If the spec already has some build steps checked off (`- [x]`), this
feature was started earlier and interrupted (often a cleared context). The spec and
its ticked steps are files, so pick up where it left off: read which steps are done,
check the git branch and `git status`/log to see what is committed and what is still
in the working tree, then continue from the **first unchecked step** instead of
starting over. No separate save/load is needed - the project instructions load
`current-feature.md` every session.

## Step 1 - branch

Create and check out a branch named from the spec: `feature/<name>` for a feature,
`fix/<name>` for a fix, or `rollback/<name>` for a Type: Rollback spec. If the
project isn't a git repo yet, say so and ask the user to run `git init` first;
the loop needs branches. On resume, the branch already exists - check it out
instead of creating a new one.

### Type: Rollback safeguard

For a rollback spec, do not hand-delete the old feature and do not run a whole
commit `git revert`. Completed feature commits also contain Blueprint history and
plan bookkeeping, while `current-feature.md` now contains the active rollback
spec. Reversing the whole commit would damage that state.

Before the first rollback build step:

1. Re-resolve the target archive's introducing commit and confirm it matches the
   full Target commit SHA recorded in the approved spec.
2. Confirm the target is an ancestor of `HEAD`, has the recorded single parent,
   and the only dirty path before applying the patch is the approved rollback
   spec. Stop on drift.
3. Preview the target's product diff while excluding `.agents/**`, `.claude/**`,
   `blueprint/**`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and
   `prototypes/**`. Confirm the preview is non-empty and matches the Product
   paths in the spec.
4. Apply that product diff in reverse with three-way conflict detection and
   stage it. Substitute the two approved full SHAs before running:

       git diff --binary <target-parent> <target-commit> -- . \
         ':(exclude).agents/**' \
         ':(exclude).claude/**' ':(exclude)blueprint/**' \
         ':(exclude)AGENTS.md' ':(exclude)CLAUDE.md' \
         ':(exclude)prototypes/**' |
         git apply --reverse --3way --index

   Never omit the protected pathspec exclusions for convenience.
5. Show both `git diff --cached` and `git status`. Confirm no protected path is
   staged or modified before presenting the step for review.

If the reverse patch conflicts, stop and report the exact paths and later commit
that appears involved. Do not auto-resolve, discard, stash, reset, or switch to a
broad checkout. Ask whether to resolve only the conflict allowed by the approved
spec or abandon the attempt. A cascade into another completed feature needs a
new rollback plan.

## Step 2 - build one step, review, iterate, checkpoint

Work through the spec's build steps in order, one at a time. For each step:

1. Implement just that step: the smallest change that satisfies its "done when."
2. Show the **diff**, not whole files.
3. **Explain it, and prove it.** Give a short summary: what the step delivered,
   one line per changed file on what it does and why, then confirm the step's
   "done when" is met with evidence (build output, a screenshot, a passing
   assertion). This summary is the comprehension gate, so keep it concrete, not
   ceremonial. Include a short **How to try it** note when the step has a manual
   path: the command, URL, click, endpoint, or output the user can check.
4. **Verify the step.** If `AGENTS.md` declares a `Verify` command, run that exact
   command as the automated gate. It is only an umbrella for checks the project
   actually has, so do not invent tests or other checks to satisfy it. If no
   `Verify` command exists, run the documented build command and the test command
   when the project declares one. A step that adds logic must ship a passing test
   in the same diff when the test gate is on, and the suite must be green before
   the step is approved (see the Testing gate in `coding-standards.md`). UI and
   integration-only steps ride on screenshot plus build evidence. Run a focused
   test separately when it gives faster feedback, then use `Verify` as the final
   automated gate. For UI or integration done-whens, prefer Playwright when it is
   already installed or declared in `AGENTS.md`; do not add it silently for an
   unrelated feature. Create focused test files next to the source they cover,
   per `coding-standards.md`. Never install a runner mid-step unless the current
   spec is explicitly the unit-testing setup itself (for example `/fix "add unit
   testing"`). If a step surfaces non-trivial logic the spec did not foresee, add
   a focused test then, or note why not. When a step's done-when is behavioral (a
   click, a download, or a flow across screens), run `/check` to prove it against
   the running app rather than eyeballing it.
5. **Iterate until it works.** If it fails or the user wants changes, revise the
   step (re-prompt or hand-edit the code), show the updated diff, and re-test.
   Repeat until it works and the user approves. Nothing is committed until the
   user is happy with the step.
6. **Mark it done, then prompt to move on.** Once the step is approved, check that
   step off (`- [x]`) in `blueprint/context/current-feature.md` so progress survives a context
   clear. If the step repaired a finding tracked in
   `blueprint/context/findings.md`, set that finding's status to `fixed` now too
   and note the repair in its **Resolution** line. Never set `closed`: a repair
   is re-reviewed by `/audit` before it clears, because a fix can introduce a
   worse defect than the one it removed. Then offer a short choice, noting that checkpoints are optional since
   `/complete` makes the real feature-level commit. Use the current tool's short
   user-input prompt when available; when you've just produced a long block to
   read (a deep explanation, a big
   walk-through), ask in plain text instead, so the prompt doesn't cover what the
   user is still reading:
   - **Continue** (default) - roll into the next step without committing.
   - **Commit checkpoint** - commit just this step on the branch with a
     conventional message (a cheap rollback point).
   - **Walk me through it** - give a deeper, line-level explanation of the new or
     changed code (why this approach, what each part does, any gotchas), then
     re-ask this checkpoint prompt. A loop-back, not a terminal choice.
   - **Stop here** - pause the loop so the user can review or come back later.

   On **Continue** or after **Commit checkpoint**, go to the next step. On **Walk
   me through it**, explain in depth and then re-ask this prompt in plain text (the
   explanation is long, so a modal would cover it). On **Stop here**, stop and say
   where things stand: the branch is intact; run `/implement` again to resume, or
   `/complete` to wrap up what's built so far.

Never batch the whole thing into one diff. If a step's diff is too big to read,
split it. The documented `Verify` command, or the fallback build and tests, must
pass before any commit.

## Step 3 - hand off to /complete

Before handing off, check `blueprint/context/findings.md`. A P0 or P1 finding
still `open` or `fixed` there means `/complete` will refuse the merge, so close
the loop now:

- Repair each `open` P0 or P1 as an extra reviewed step. First append it to the
  spec's build steps in `current-feature.md` (`- [ ] Repair F-03 - <title>`) so
  the repair is on the record and survives a context clear, then run the same
  loop as Step 2: smallest change, diff, plain-English explanation, evidence.
  Check the step off and mark the finding `fixed` together.
- Then run `/audit` so the repairs are re-reviewed and can move to `closed`.
  A repair this skill made never closes itself.
- If the user decides a finding should not be fixed, only they can set
  `accepted` (reason recorded). A finding that looks wrong goes back to
  `/audit` to invalidate with recorded evidence; this skill never sets
  `accepted` or `invalid`.

When every step is built and `Verify`, or the fallback build and tests, passes
(committed as checkpoints or not), stop with a compact review packet:

- branch name
- what changed, grouped by file or area
- checks run, with the exact command or proof used
- how to try it manually, or a pointer to `/try`
- ledger state: any findings still `open` or `fixed`, by ID
- known risks, skipped checks, or follow-up notes
- next action, usually `/complete`

Then tell the user `/complete` makes the one work-level commit, logs it (archive,
update the build plan for a feature or rollback, reset), and merges with
approval. This skill does not touch main.

## Rules

- One small step per diff; the user reviews and approves each before any commit.
- Explain every change in plain English. Understanding the code is the point.
- Iterate on the branch until each step works; never commit code the user hasn't
  approved.
- Follow `blueprint/context/coding-standards.md` (server vs client, scope user-owned queries
  by the authenticated user id, validate inputs, and so on).
- Build only what the spec says. If the spec is wrong or thin, stop and fix the
  spec first, do not improvise.
- Per-step commits are optional checkpoints. The work-level commit, the merge,
  and any push are `/complete`'s job.
- For Type: Rollback, reverse only the approved product diff and preserve all
  protected Blueprint paths.

## Formatting

Format the output to match the project's conventions in
`blueprint/context/ai-interaction.md`: concise, scannable markdown, with lists for
enumerations and tables for matrices rather than dense paragraphs.
